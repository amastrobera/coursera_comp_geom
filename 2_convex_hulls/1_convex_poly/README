1. Verify that the input polygon is convex

it is guaranteed that:
- vertices are in counter clockwise order
- no 3 consecutive vertices are on the same line
- each coordinate does not exceed abs val of 1000


outputs =  CONVEX | NOT_CONVEX

**requirements**
language: C++ (11) 
OS: ubuntu 18.04
compiler: g++ v 7.4.0 (lower version is also fine)

**compile with**
```
g++ -I. -std=c++11 main.cpp   # will output a.out
```

**launch with**
```
cat data1.txt | ./a.out
cat data2.txt | ./a.out
```
