2. Make the convex hull of a set of points 

it is guaranteed that:
- no 3 consecutive vertices are on the same line
- each coordinate does not exceed abs val of 100,000


outputs =  N(vertices)
               +
          X1 Y1 X2 Y2 ..... Xn Yn  (counter clockwise order)

**requirements**
language: C++ (11) 
OS: ubuntu 18.04
compiler: g++ v 7.4.0 (lower version is also fine)

**compile with**
```
g++ -I. -std=c++11 main.cpp   # will output a.out
```

**launch with**
```
cat data1.txt | ./a.out
cat data2.txt | ./a.out
cat data3.txt | ./a.out
```

or with 
```
for f in $(ls data*.txt); do cat $f | ./a.out; done
```
