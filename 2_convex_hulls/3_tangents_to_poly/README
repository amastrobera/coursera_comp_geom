3. Create tangents to a convex polygon

For each point in the list, make the two tangents

it is guaranteed that:
- each point is outside of the polygon
- polygon n verices >= 3 and <= 1000, listed counter clockwise
- m points >= 1 and <= 1000, their value does not exceed abs val of 1,000,000

input = n (vertices)
            +
        X1 Y1 X2 Y2 .... Xn Yn
            +
        m (points)
        X Y
        X Y
        ... m times

outputs = X Y
        for each m point given 
        
**requirements**
language: C++ (11) 
OS: ubuntu 18.04
compiler: g++ v 7.4.0 (lower version is also fine)

**compile with**
```
g++ -pipe -O2 -std=c++14 main.cpp -lm  # will output a.out
```

**launch with**
```
cat data1.txt | ./a.out
cat data2.txt | ./a.out
```

or with 
```
for f in $(ls data*.txt); do cat $f | ./a.out; done
```
